# Sentiment_Analysis
This repository contains the data and code for the sentiment analysis and topic modeling of tweets about ChatGPT cybersecurity. The project aims to analyze the sentiments of ChatGPT users in the field of cybersecurity. Two sentiment models including the VADER and roBERTa are explored in the project. We extracted relevant topics that aim to help us understand the sentiments using the ``LDA`` model. To execute the `code`, you will need to obtain the tweets using the appropiate API. The SNScrape api was used for this research.
